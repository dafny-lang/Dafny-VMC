# VMC: a Library for Verified Monte Carlo Algorithms

The `Random` module introduces utils for probabilistic reasoning in Dafny. At the moment, the API (see `Library/RandomTrait.dfy`) is intentionally limited in scope, and only supports compilation to Java. For the future, we plan to extend both the functionality and the range of supported languages.

To use `Random` in your code, you must:

1. `include` and `import` the `Random` module as you would any other library module
2. incorporate the corresponding language-specific implementation file (that is, currently, `Library/Random.java`) when building or running your program

For example, to run the `Examples.dfy` file in the `Examples` directory with the `Random` module, run the following.

```bash
# Java
$ dafny run Examples.dfy --target:java --input ./Library/Random.java
```

(If you aren't using `dafny run` to run your program,
then you should instead integrate the appropriate language-specific implementation file in your build system.)
